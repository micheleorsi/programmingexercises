Sample Input (for each customer, product history)
C1,A,B,C
C2,B,A
C3,A,D,B
C4,A
C5,E

Preprocessing step (done once). Build inverted index (for each product, who bought it):
A,C1(0),C3(0),C4(0),C2(1)
B,C2(0),C1(1),C3(2)
C,C1(2)
D,C3(1)
E,C5(0)
Note that for each customer I keep the index (tra parentesi) of the product position in the history

Sample Pattern: A,B
Who bought A?
C5 discarded.
candidates = C1,C3,C4,C2
Who bought B after A?
C4 discarded because he didn't buy B.
C2 discarded because B index (0) < A index (1).
result = C1,C3

Something like that! Implementation might be tricky but you can be fast with hashstuff.
