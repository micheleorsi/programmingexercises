/**
 * 
 * Imagine a (literal) stack of plates. 
 * If the stack gets too high, it might topple. 
 * Therefore, in real life, we would likely start a new stack when the previous stack exceeds some threshold. 
 * Implement a data structureSetOf Stacks that mimics this. 
 * SetOf Stacks should be composed of several stacks and should create a new stack once the previous one exceeds capacity. 
 * SetOfStacks.push() and SetOfStacks.pop() should behave identically to a singlestack (thatis,popO should return the same values as it would if there were just a single stack).
 * 
 * FOLLOW UP
 * Implement a function popAt(int index) which performs a pop operation on a specific sub-stack
