 * You have two very large binary trees: T l, with millions of nodes, and T2, with hundreds of nodes. Create an algorithm to decide ifT2 is a subtree of Tl.
 * A tree T2 is a subtree of Tl if there exists a node n in Tl such that the subtree of n is identical to T2. That is, if you cut off the tree at node n, the two trees would be identical.
