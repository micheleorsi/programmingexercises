 * 
 * Imagine you landed a new job as a cashier...
 * Your quirky boss found out that you're a programmer and has a weird request about something they've been wondering for a long time.
 * Write a function that, given:
 * 
 * 1. an amount of money
 * 2. a list of coin denominations
 * 
 * computes the number of ways to make amount of money with coins of the available denominations.
 * 
 * Example: for amount=4 (4C) and denominations=[1,2,3](1C, 2C and 3C), your program would output 
 * 4â€”the number of ways to make 4C with those denominations
 * 
 * 1. 1C, 1C, 1C, 1C
 * 2. 1C, 1C, 2C
 * 3. 1C, 3C
 * 4. 2C, 2C
