/**
 * 
 * A crack team of love scientists from OkEros (a hot new dating site) have devised a way to represent dating profiles as rectangles on a two-dimensional plane.
 * They need help writing an algorithm to find the intersection of two users' love rectangles. 
 * They suspect finding that intersection is the key to a matching algorithm so powerful it will cause an immediate acquisition by Google or Facebook or Obama or something.
 * 
 * Write a function to find the rectangular intersection of two given love rectangles.
 * 
 * As with the example above, love rectangles are always "straight" and never "diagonal." More rigorously: each side is parallel with either the x-axis or the y-axis.
 * 
 * They are defined as hash maps â†´ like this:
 * my_rectangle = { 
 * 
 * # coordinates of bottom-left corner:
 *  'x': 1,
 *  'y': 5,
 * 
 * # width and height
 * 	'width': 10,
 *	'height': 4,
 * }
 * 
 * Your output rectangle should use this format as well.
